# Companion App for KH BBS

This app provides an interface to easily find which commands to mix together to get the right final a command and the right ability attached to it.

## Todo list

1. Create an Air Table from KH Destiny data : https://www.khdestiny.fr/kingdom-hearts-birth-by-sleep-final-mix-hd-2-5-remix-mixage-commandes.html
2. Initialiser a VueJS App
3. Create configurator just like in the game
4. Create a search engine with a listing :
   * to search for a recipe
   * to search between characters Terra / Ventus / Aqua
   * to search for an ingredient in the recipe
   * to search from the ability

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

If the standalone TypeScript plugin doesn't feel fast enough to you, Volar has also implemented a [Take Over Mode](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar/discussions/471#discussioncomment-1361669) that is more performant. You can enable it by the following steps:

1. Disable the built-in TypeScript Extension
    1) Run `Extensions: Show Built-in Extensions` from VSCode's command palette
    2) Find `TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features`, right click and select `Disable (Workspace)`
2. Reload the VSCode window by running `Developer: Reload Window` from the command palette.
